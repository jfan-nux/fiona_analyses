# Interrupted Time Series Causal Impact Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Change Date:** September 25, 2025  
**Analysis Method:** Interrupted Time Series (ITS) Segmented Regression  
**Analysis Period:** September 12-24 (13 days pre) vs September 25 - October 7 (13 days post)

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Unexpected Result: POSITIVE Impact Despite Initial Analysis

The ITS causal analysis reveals a **different story** than the simple pre-post comparison:

#### All Platforms Combined
- **Purchase CVR Impact:** **+1.88 pp** (+6.54% relative increase)
- **Daily Purchasers Impact:** **+4,067** purchasers/day (+29.44% relative increase)
- **Cumulative Purchasers:** **+52,875** additional purchasers over 13 days
- **Statistical Significance:** Not statistically significant (p > 0.05), likely due to high day-to-day variance and downward trend in pre-period

#### By Platform

**iOS:**
- Purchase CVR: +1.55 pp (+5.38% increase)
- Daily Purchasers: +1,994/day (+25.18%)
- Cumulative: +25,918 purchasers over 13 days

**Android:**
- Purchase CVR: +2.34 pp (+8.11% increase)
- Daily Purchasers: +2,074/day (+35.17%)
- Cumulative: +26,957 purchasers over 13 days
- **Note:** Android p-value = 0.0555 (marginally significant)

## 📊 Why the Different Results?

### Simple Pre-Post showed NEGATIVE impact:
- Pre CVR: 30.96%
- Post CVR: 30.77%
- Difference: -0.18 pp

### ITS Causal Analysis shows POSITIVE impact:
- Observed Post: 30.67%
- **Counterfactual** (predicted without change): 28.79%
- **Causal Effect:** +1.88 pp

### The Key Difference: **Accounting for Pre-Existing Trends**

The ITS model detected a **declining trend** in the pre-period (β1 = -0.16 pp/day, p=0.27). This means:

1. **Without the intervention**, metrics would have continued declining
2. The **counterfactual** (what would have happened) was lower than observed
3. The intervention appears to have **arrested or reversed the decline**

This is visualized in the plots showing:
- Observed values (blue line)
- Counterfactual prediction (red dashed line)
- Shaded area = causal effect

## 🧩 Methodology

**Interrupted Time Series Regression Model:**
```
Y = β0 + β1*time + β2*intervention + β3*time_since_intervention + ε
```

**Parameters:**
- **β0:** Baseline level at start
- **β1:** Pre-intervention trend (slope) - captures existing trends
- **β2:** Immediate level change at intervention point - **KEY METRIC**
- **β3:** Change in post-intervention trend
- **Causal Effect:** Observed - Counterfactual (in post-period)

## 🔬 Statistical Interpretation

**None of the effects reach traditional statistical significance (p < 0.05)**, with Android purchasers being marginally significant (p = 0.056).

**However, the direction and magnitude are consistent:**
- All platforms show positive effects
- Android shows stronger effects than iOS
- Effects are economically meaningful even if not statistically significant

## ⚠️ Important Caveats

### 1. **Statistical Power Limitations**
- Short time series (26 days total)
- High day-to-day variance
- Only 13 post-intervention days
- **Need more data** to reach statistical significance

### 2. **Pre-Period Trend**
- Declining trend detected in pre-period
- This could be seasonal, random walk, or other factors
- The model assumes this trend would continue without intervention

### 3. **Confounding Factors**
- No control for external events (e.g., holidays, marketing campaigns)
- Day-of-week effects not modeled
- Other simultaneous changes not accounted for

## 💡 Recommendations

### 1. **Continue Monitoring**
- Collect more post-intervention data (aim for 30+ days)
- Re-run analysis with longer time series for better statistical power

### 2. **Investigate the Pre-Period Decline**
- Understand why metrics were declining before 9/25
- Rule out seasonal or other systematic factors

### 3. **Consider the Economic Impact**
- Even without statistical significance, **+52,875 cumulative purchasers** is substantial
- **Risk assessment:** What's the cost if we're wrong about the effect?

### 4. **If Possible, Run A/B Test**
- For definitive causal inference, consider randomized experiment
- Control for confounding variables

## 🔍 Conclusion

**The ITS analysis suggests the 9/25 change may have had a POSITIVE causal impact** by preventing or reversing a pre-existing decline, even though:

1. The simple pre-post comparison showed a slight decrease
2. The effects are not statistically significant due to limited sample size and high variance
3. More data is needed for conclusive evidence

The consistent positive direction across all platforms and metrics, combined with the large economic magnitude (+52K cumulative purchasers), suggests the change may have been beneficial despite the lack of formal statistical significance.
