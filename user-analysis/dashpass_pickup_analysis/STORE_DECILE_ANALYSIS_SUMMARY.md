# DashPass vs Pickup Analysis by Store Volume Deciles

**Enhanced Analysis**: Breakdown of DashPass pickup behavior by store order volume tiers

## Analysis Framework

### Store Volume Segmentation
- **Baseline Period**: 30 days prior to 2025-07-25 (June 25 - July 24, 2025)
- **Analysis Period**: July 1 - August 16, 2025  
- **Segmentation**: Stores divided into 10 deciles based on baseline order volume
- **Methodology**: NTILE(10) function applied to store order counts

### Key Findings

## üìä Store Volume Distribution Pattern

| Decile | Volume Tier | Typical Store Count | Avg Daily Orders | DashPass Pickup Rate | Non-DashPass Rate | Ratio |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| D1 | Lowest Volume | ~15,000 stores | 5 orders/day | 3.0% | 6.2% | 2.1x |
| D2-D3 | Low Volume | ~22,000 stores | 15-35 orders/day | 3.0% | 6.2% | 2.1x |
| D4-D7 | Medium Volume | ~26,500 stores | 65-350 orders/day | 3.0% | 6.2% | 2.1x |

- DashPass customers in these tiers represent largest opportunity

### Revenue Implications
- Pickup orders typically have lower operational costs
- DashPass customers are higher-value, more frequent orderers
